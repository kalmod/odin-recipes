    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped Chinese chives</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®)</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped Chinese chives</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons sesame oil</li>Large or small, these triple chocolate cookies are crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Refrigerating the batter for 48 hours before baking is ideal, as this allows the dough to fully form its flavor.</li>
        <li>50 dumpling wrappers</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 quart water, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 1</strong>
            <p>
                Combine 1/2 cup soy sauce, rice vinegar, 1 tablespoon chives, sesame seeds, and chile sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 2</strong>
            <p>Mix pork, garlic, egg, 2 tablespoons chives, soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Place a dumpling wrapper on a lightly floured work surface and spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the middle. Wet the edge with a little water and crimp together forming small pleats to seal the dumpling. Repeat with remaining dumpling wrappers and filling.

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 3</strong>
            <p>Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place 8 to 10 dumplings in the pan and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Pour in 1 cup of water, cover and cook until the dumplings are tender and the pork is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Repeat for remaining dumplings. Serve with soy sauce mixture for dipping.
